## Introduction
This project aims to analyze airline data âœˆ to identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate on low-performing flights, ultimately boosting the profitability of the airline. The analyses are conducted using SQL and Python.

## Data Exploration
Find the database from here: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadkaiftahir/airline-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadkaiftahir/airline-dataset)
The dataset comprises various tables such as aircrafts_data, airports_data, boarding_passes, bookings, flights, seats, ticket_flights, and tickets. These tables contain information about aircraft, airports, bookings, flights, seating, and ticketing.

## Basic Analysis
- The number of seats on each aircraft type is examined.
- Changes in the number of tickets booked and total amount earned over time are analyzed.
- The average charges for different fare conditions on each aircraft are calculated.

## Analyzing Occupancy Rate
- The total revenue per year and average revenue per ticket for each aircraft are computed.
- The average occupancy rate per aircraft is determined.
- The potential increase in total annual turnover by improving the occupancy rate by 10% for all aircraft is estimated.
